  - text: "It is known that the policy we follow is a peaceful policy. The attempt to trample and have our country trampled without any basis in right and justice has been met with the failure it deserved through the self-sacrificing efforts of our victorious army, and our nation has saved our beloved homeland by achieving a victory rarely recorded in history."
