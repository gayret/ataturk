  - text: "We see the need to remove Islam from its position as a political tool, as has been customary for centuries, and to elevate it. It is imperative, for the sake of the nation's happiness in this world and the next, to rescue our sacred and divine beliefs and moral values from politics and all its aspects, which are dark and uncertain and a stage for all kinds of interests and passions to emerge. Only in this way will the greatness of Islam be revealed."
